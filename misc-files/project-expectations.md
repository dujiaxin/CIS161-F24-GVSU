# Course Project Expectations

This is designed to help everyone plan ahead, understand the project expectations, and understand how the course project will be graded.

## When is it due?
The course project (report with code and presentation) is due by 11:59pm on Dec/09/2024.  Late projects will not be accepted.

Note the HuMob challenge due at September 20, 2024 if you want to participate a real data science challenge.

## If you choose your own project
The goal for these projects is that it allows you to bring
together all of the knowledge and skills covered throughout
the course and to apply them to a discipline you find
interesting.  As the course project is a significant portion
of the overall course grade, this
The deliverables for the final project will be:

* A presentation delivered to the class during the final exam
  time period.
* A write-up that will contain your code, results, etc.
  This will be a jupyter notebook.

In addition to these deliverables, there will be 2 intermediate,
short, check-in assignments.

* Project Ideas:  A short list of 3 potential project ideas.
  Each idea only needs to be 1-2 sentences.  This will be
  submitted in week 4 (exact due date TBA).  This is just
  to make sure you are thinking about the project -- you
  are free to choose an idea other than one of the 3 you
  submit.
* Project Proposal:  A 1 paragraph description of the
  chosen project and the work that has been done so far.
  There is no set amount of work that has to be done by
  this point, but there should be enough done to identify
  any early issues.  This will be submitted in week 9
  (exact due date TBA).  The purpose of this is to
  make sure that you:

  1. have not simply forgotten about the course project
  2. have started looking into it enough to evaluate
     whether it is feasible

The final, completed course projects will be due at the start
of our scheduled final exam time.
In addition to your project, you are expected to be paying attention
to other student's project presentations.

The project is your opportunity to show me what you've learned.  Combining
code from multiple online resources or simply following a tutorial is not an acceptable
project.  Showing me what you can do is more important that creating a flashy project.
I encourage you to push your boundaries, but projects that are clearly well-beyond
what is reasonable given your other work in the course are frequently an indication
of academic misconduct.

## What are the deliverables?

#### 1. Report
This is a single report in the form of a jupyter notebook in your project on CoCalc.  More specifically:
   * this should be in the shared one if you are working with your partner or your individual one if you are completing the project on your own.
   * this report should be professional looking (think like how the notebooks in the lecture videos look).  
   * text should be formatted, equations should be entered as math with latex.  You should be able to get a basic working knowledge of markdown by double clicking on the markdown cells in the labs/class notebooks.  If you want a more detailed introduction of markdown, [this guide](https://jupyter.brynmawr.edu/services/public/dblank/Jupyter%20Notebook%20Users%20Manual.ipynb#4.-Using-Markdown-Cells-for-Writing) walks through all of the formatting that's available in more detail.
   * the formatted text part should explain your code and be interwoven with your code and results.  You should explain what you did and why.  You should also explain other things you tried, what worked, what didn't, etc.  This should be something you'd be proud to show someone at a job interview.  Think of this like a report you'd be producing for your boss at a job.
   * In rare circumstances (basically if it's impossible to code what you are trying in a jupyter notebook because it involves something not compatible with jupyter notebooks), it is okay if your code is not included in the report (but you must still have a nicely formatted, professional report).  If your group falls into this scenario, I would have been  specific about this when providing feedback on your project ideas.  If you fall under this scenario, you can either upload your .py files separately or link to something like github.  **All other groups that haven't received permission to have the code be separate will be expected to have the single formatted report with code, text, and results are interwoven.**

#### 2. Presentation
You need to create a short (approximately 5 min) recorded presentation to your classmates.
   * This presentation should walk through your project, demo the code and show what it does.
   * The recording does not need to show your face, but should show your screen and record audio.
   * One easy way to do this is to use Zoom.  Basically you can make a meeting with just you and your partner in it, share screen, and record the meeting as you talk.  You are free to use other ways as well.
   * Presentations need to be posted on Github by the due date.
   * You are also expected to watch your classmates presentations and comment on a couple (at least 2).

## How will my project be graded?
The project will be graded out of 100 points according to the following rubric.  Note that your grade will may be raised or lowered from this rubric depending on your contribution to the project (e.g. if your partner does all the work, you will likely receive a much lower grade).
| Component | Points | Description |
| --------- | ------ | ----------- |
| Project Idea & Project Check-in | 10 | Project ideas and check-in were turned in and satisfactory |
| Code / Topic | 45 | Code runs correctly without errors.  Code accomplishes the task you described correctly.  Topic was of appropriate level of depth (not too easy).  Code is clean, uses good variable names, etc.  Note, there's no minimum number of lines of code or anything like that, the point is that you have showed me comprehensively what you've learned in the course and that you are capable of applying the knowledge you've learned to something new.
| Report | 25 | The report should be professional looking, well-formatted.  It should be clear and easy to read.  It should describe what you did, why, and your results. See above for more details |
| Presentation | 15 | The presentation should demonstrate your project to others.  There's no need to prepare slides, just think of this like going up to the projector in person and taking 5 minutes to show what you did.  This is your opportunity to share. |
| Impress Me | 5 | This is your opportunity to really show me that you've learned something.  Try going above and beyond what we covered.  This could be as simple as using a library or something else that we didn't talk about (like accepting user input, using pandas, some sort of GUI) or really going above and beyond in some other way, like making really nice looking plots.  This is basically your opportunity to show me that you can learn some more python related stuff on your own, beyond what we've learned in the course.  Note:  you can still get a 95 (an A) on the project without doing this, so don't worry to much about it. |

## Partner Ratings / Fair Contributions
While your project as a whole is graded according to the above rubric, you or your partner's grade may be lowered if the workload on the project was very one-sided.  To help check for this, each student will be privately (in their individual project on CoCalc) rating their partner(s) on a scale of 1=awful to 5=great and describing very briefly what their and their partner's contributions were to the work.  This can be as simple as, we met weekly and coded the whole project together.  Note, the workload doesn't have to be perfect but each person should be participating and contributing.

In general, if you think this is going to be an issue, you should
1. Make it clear to your partner that you don't believe they are contributing their fair share of the work.  
2. Detail what you did to inform them that you wanted them to contribute more when you rate them (doesn't have to be super detailed, just a short description of how you tried to bring them in).  This is to make sure that they were given a chance to contribute.

If I have any concerns about very inequitable work on the project, you may be required to setup a zoom meeting with me to explain the project to me, so each person should be comfortable with the project as a whole.
