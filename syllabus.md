## Course Description
Computational science is the field of study concerned with using computers to analyze, model, simulate, and solve problems in various mathematical and scientific disciplines.

Prerequisite: MTH 201

Credits: 3


## Github
We will be using Github **all class related communication**.
In particular, note that important announcements will be posted
to Github and you are responsible for monitoring it and
that **all questions and concerns**
should be posted to Github (instead of emailed).  Emails
will likely be redirected to be posted to Github and then
answered there.  

## Textbook
No official textbook - the Jupyter notebooks are meant to replace a traditional textbook.
If you prefer to run the Jupyter notebooks in the videos on Google CoLab,
the "Run Online" links posted on
[Python for Applied Computing Github](https://github.com/dujiaxin/python-for-applied-computing)
will open them automatically in CoLab.

## Extra Credit
Extra credit will be awarded for good questions (as marked by the
  instructor) and good answers (as endorsed by the instructor).  The
  exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
  be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.

## Course Policies
This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
[http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).

### General Course Policies
* All activities must be completed on
  [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/).
  Emailed code will not be accepted.
* All assignments should be turned in on PrairieLearn.
* Late assignments
  will not be accepted, except in very extenuating
  circumstances (e.g. extremely severe illness, etc.).  This is done
  as the goal of these is to make sure you are keeping up
  with the material.
  Any work done on an assignment
  after the posted due date and time will not be counted for credit.
* If health issues for you or someone you care for,
  longer term internet issues, childcare issues, etc.
  arise, please email the
  instructor ASAP so we can work together to
  identify a solution.
* There may be a need for changes to happen midsemester, so this
  information is tentative and the
  instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course
  calendar, due dates, number of assignments, etc.

### Flipped Classroom
This course will be run as a flipped classroom.  You will be responsible
for watching lecture videos before coming to class.  In-class time will be used
for discussion over topics covered in the videos and completing activities,
and working on labs.

The goal of the flipped classroom is so that you can get help when you need it.
With coding, often student's do not realize their misunderstandings until it
comes time to apply the material.  So, rather than using class time for lectures,
class time will be devoted to applying the material so that students can get help
when they need it.

### Activities (PrairieLearn)
[PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/)
will be used for regular, short activities.
The idea of these activities is to allow you to try out
and check your understanding of the material covered in the
lecture videos.
PL is an online system that will allow you to submit your
code for autograding.  You will be able to submit, see whether
or not you got it correct, and resubmit
prior to the due date/time to improve your grade
without penalty as
many times as you wish.  Unless otherwise stated,
all activities are due at the end of the week on Friday at 11:59pm.

You should keep trying these activities until you are able
to get them correct.   My goal is that
everyone will be able to get full credit for all of these
activities -- the autograder is meant to be a positive that
helps your understanding and grade, not a negative.

### Labs
Friday will be dedicated to completing
labs.  The lab task will be available on PrairieLearn at the beginning
of the lab class period.  Other lab policies:

* Labs must be completed with your assigned partner.
  Partners will be assigned in the first week based on
  the results of a survey.
* Most labs are designed to be finished during the dedicated
  lab time, assuming you come prepared and have watched the
  video lectures and completed the activities for the week.
  Labs must be completed within 1 week (e.g., before the start of the
  next lab class day).
* When you finish the lab task, let the instructor know so
  you can demo it.  If you do not complete it
  in the lab session it is assigned, you may demo during
  office hours, during other activity time during class periods, or during the
  next lab.

### Exams (PrairieLearn)
There will be multiple midterm exams (tentatively week 5 and week 11)
that will be taken on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/) and consist of both
non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.) questions
and one or more coding questions.

The room will be recorded during exams to ensure academic integrity.
By taking the exams you consent to being recorded.
Please reach out to the professor no later than the end of the first
week of class if you have concerns.

### Course Project
In lieu of a final exam, each student (individually or with
a partner) will complete a culminating project of your choice. 
The default choice is the [HuMob Challenge 2024](https://wp.nyu.edu/humobchallenge2024/). 
Please discuss with the instructor before September if you intended to choose a project of your own.


### Academic Honesty Policies
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards
set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students
in this course are expected to adhere to the [academic honesty
guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

Academic honesty is taken seriously.  Penalties may be different for
undergraduate and graduate students.  If you have any questions about what is
allowed, it is your responsibility to check with the instructor first.

For this course:
* **Activities**:  are to be completed individually.  You may discuss the
  activities in general with others, but you should not sharing/copying code.
* **Labs**:  your lab should be completed with your assigned
  partner. Code should not be shared among members of different lab groups.
  Each partner should fully understand the code that is turned in for the lab.
* **Projects**:  may be completed individually or with a
  partner.  While you can discuss your project idea in general with others,
  fundamentally the work you submit for you project must be your own.  If working
  with a partner, both partners are expected to understand the project and be
  capable of explaining it.
* **Exams**:  Exams are to be completed individually.  Exams are open-book,
  open-note, open general internet resources (for something like python documentation).
  You are free to look at the class demos,
  lectures, labs, and activities while taking the exam.  You may not attempt to
  find or use a full solution to the problem
  (or a solution to a large component of the problem) online.
  Additionally, you can not
  discuss or share any portion of the exam with another
  individual (whether or not they are taking this class).  You are also
  not allowed to benefit from any other student that may have sought outside help.
  Using any unauthorized resource on exams will be considered an academic integrity
  violation and will result in a grade penalty (up to failure in the course) as
  well as be reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

#### FAQs:
  * Can I use ChatGPT, Github Co-pilot, or similar AI/ML based technologies? *No, for in-class activities, labs, and exams. The work you submit must be your own, and all code should be written by you. Using AI tools in these contexts would be considered an academic integrity violation.Special case: For the course project, you are encouraged to use AI tools but must take full responsibility for the AI-generated content.*
  * Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
    considered an academic integrity violation*
  * Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
    you submit for projects/labs/activities in the end must be your own.  You may not consult
    tutors when taking exams.*
  * Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course,
    so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
    for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
    portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).
    Fundamentally the work you submit must be your own.*
  * Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
    integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*
  * Can I just piece together existing code found online for my project?  *No,
    this would be considered an academic integrity violation. Fundamentally the
    work you submit must be your own*.

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date for an activity/lab or within 48 hours of completing an exam, you can
withdraw your submission if after contemplation you believe you may have committed
academic misconduct.  To do so, you must inform me in via email within 48 hours of the due date / late deadline including the following text:
> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
   invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date / late
deadline / exam completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.
